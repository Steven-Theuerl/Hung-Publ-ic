# Hung (TBD) – A Narrative Game About Justice, Morality, and Consequence

Hung (TBD) is my most ambitious personal project to date — a custom-built narrative game exploring complex themes like justice, ethics, and the human cost of decision-making.

This project is currently under development. It is being built entirely from scratch using a custom fullstack setup, with a strong emphasis on performance, local-first design, and meaningful interactivity.

## 🎯 What Is Hung?

It’s a deeply interactive experience that challenges players to engage with difficult moral questions — not just through story, but through **active participation and consequence**.

- Built with a modern, performance-focused tech stack  
- Designed for offline-first, single-player narrative gameplay  
- Focuses on ethical ambiguity, procedural variation, and replayability  
- Player decisions have lasting consequences — both in-game and across playthroughs

## 🚧 Status

Actively in development.

The game is being built as a standalone desktop app with a fully customized architecture, original gameplay loop, and evolving narrative structure. No external frameworks for gameplay systems are being used — everything is purpose-built to support the game's tone and intent.
